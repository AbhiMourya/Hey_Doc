## Problem Statement:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. One of the biggest challenges for patients with Parkinson's disease is the lack of reliable and accurate methods for early diagnosis.


One of the most common effects noticeable among the PD patients in the early stage of diagnosis is finding the difference in handwriting and sketching abilities like the sketching of shapes as spirals and waves. Traditionally the sketching was performed in the papers and interpreted manually by the interpreters specialised in those fields, which is time consuming and prone to human error.
Therefore, the challenge for the hackfest is to develop innovative and practical solutions that leverage technology to improve the early detection and assistance to patients of Parkinson's disease leveraging the potential of Machine Learning.

## Solution:
With the availability of digital devices, it is easier to perform those tasks digitally as well as the assessments were done by the machine in a more precise and accurate manner compared to the traditional ways. In this respect machine learning techniques are effective. Our app includes the following features:		
App for helping users diagnose early stage Parkinson's disease by spiral-wave drawing test, hosting doctors relevant to the disease, allowing users to find a doctor as well as booking an online appointment with a doctor via video-calls.
Doctors can host their clinics, connect with patients.
Machine learning for predicting the severity of the disease in the patient and suggesting whether to book an appointment with a doctor or not.
Cloud based solution for hosting static data of the users as well as for hosting the machine learning algorithm
